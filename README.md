# Beal-Conjecture
After hearing about the Beal Conjecture, I put together a quick piece of code to check each number up to 100 million using the UT supercomputer.

The conjecture:
"Beal's conjecture is a generalization of Fermat's Last Theorem. It states: If A^x + B^y = C^z, where A, B, C, x, y and z are positive integers and x, y and z are all greater than 2, then A, B and C must have a common prime factor."

The prize for proving or disproving this conjecture is 1 million dollars. Since the prize has been active since the 90s, I did not expect to find anything new, but it was still fun to throw a piece of code together to see how the numbers worked.

In the output code, you can see that the A, B, and C variables in each found equation all share a common prime factor.
